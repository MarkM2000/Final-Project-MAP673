                <h1>Outer Banks</h1>
                <p>This is the final project of the Outer Banks. I have created three mockups leading up to the this
                    project. The first mockup was done by sketch, my second mockup was done by Adobe Illustrator, and
                    the third was done with a mockup index. The final project will be focused on the Outer Banks, and I
                    will use everything that I learned with each of the mockups.</p>
                <h2>Planned features</h2>
                <p>The final project will feature tourist destinations such as hotels and lighthouses. In this mockup,
                    the placemarks represent the hotels and the circles represent the lighthouses, and both icons will
                    likely be changed. I will have a data source on which roads I plan to use for the final project.
                    This will show vacation places in the Outer Banks, and I hope to visit the Outer Banks in the
                    timeframe between 2024 and 2028 (which means I hope to visit in one of those years).</p>
